## Books vs. Movie Adaptations

Popular books often turn into movies, if they have enough potential to do so. Some classics like _To Kill a Mockingbird_ by Harper Lee, _Little Women_ by Louisa May Alcott, and so many more. However, avid fans of the books frequently find flaws in the settings, characters, and overall plot of the movies. 

### Harry Potter

_Harry Potter_ is a book/movie series by J.K. Rowling. It is very beloved by people of all ages at it provides a little bit of magic in our lives. However, it's huge fan base often criticizes the problems that they finf within the movies, especially the portrayal of their characters. 

#### Ron Weasley

Ronald Weasley, 1/3 of the Goldren Trio, son of Molly and Arthur Weasley, brother of many siblings, and one of Harry Potter's first friends at Hogwarts. In the books, he is a courageous, loyal, and smart-without-even-trying character. In the movies, however, he is portrayed as a hot-headed, lazy, and jealous person who is always envious of his best friend's, Harry Potter, fame and fortune. In the books, he introduces Harry to his family and gave him everything that the had even though he didn't have much in the first place. In the movies, it shows Ron ebing posseive and jealous, but they don't reveal his insecurities that are casung some of these actions. From this, the viewers don't get the full story. 

#### Ginny Weasley

The major flaws in Ginny Weasley's character from the movie impact her overall likeability. In the book, Ginny was this fiery, energetic, and independent character that wasn't afraid to speak her mind. The movies RUINED Ginny's character as they made her seem shy, timid, and an unsual (maybe even forced) love interest for Harry Potter. Because of this, many fans (especially the ones who only watvhed the movies) think that Ginny isn't the right match for Harry. Ginny's character's dynamic completely changed. 

#### Hermione Granger

Hermione Granger, on the other hand, is idolized in the Harry Potter fandom. She is portrayed as this perfect student who doesn't make any mistakes. However, in the books, she still had quite a lot of character flaws. Hermions often found herself obessing over school, she was clode-minded, felt insecure when she wasn't able to learn or understand a topic, and was always extremely stressed under pressure. This side of Hermione was not as conveyed in the movies as it should have. Because of this, her character flaws got put onto other characters, especially Ron Weasley.

### Percy Jackson

_Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ is a book series by Rick Riordan (there are also other series and books). There are five books in the series, but only two of the books were made into movies. The second movie, _Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters_, had many differences from the second book. Instead of sticking to original plot from the book it is based off of, the movie uses scenes that should have been in the later books. This makes the movie nothing like the book as the plotline was messed up and mixed around. Because of this, many Percy Jackson fans (like myself) have a great dislike for the movies as they don't match up with what happened in the book. Even the author, Rick Riordan, has a distaste for the movies ([read more about this](https://www.hypable.com/percy-jackson-3-movie-logan-lerman/))
